# 🚀 Advanced GIS WebApp – Phase 2: Dynamic GIS API with Flask & PostGIS

This is the **second phase** of a modern multi-part GIS web application. It introduces a dynamic backend using **Flask** and **PostgreSQL/PostGIS**, enabling real-time CRUD operations, API-driven map updates, and advanced spatial logic. It extends the static frontend from [Phase 1](https://github.com/essamun/Advanced-GIS-WebApp-Frontend) into a fully interactive GIS web service.

> 📍 Real GIS functionality. Full-stack architecture. Built with production-ready technologies.

## 🌍 Live Demo (Coming Soon)
📎 Hosted on [Render](https://render.com) — coming soon after deployment.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **QGIS** – Digitizing and spatial data prep
- **PostgreSQL + PostGIS** – Spatial database engine
- **Flask** – Lightweight Python web framework for the GIS API
- **Leaflet.js** – Map rendering and UI interactivity
- **Chart.js** – Dynamic business-type charts
- **Shapely** – Python geometry analysis (buffer, nearest point)
- **Turf.js** – Client-side geoprocessing

🔭 Part of a Multi-Phase GIS Project
This is Phase 2 of a complete GIS solution:

✅ Phase 1 – Static GIS Frontend

🔁 Phase 2 – Flask + PostGIS Backend (this repo)

🧠 Phase 3 – Coming soon: ML-powered spatial clustering and predictive GIS tools

🙌 Contributions
Built using real-world use cases near Toronto (Yonge & Finch), this project simulates how spatial databases and web tools come together to power modern GIS workflows.
